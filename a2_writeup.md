# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

While thinking about the logic in my head is easy, it is hard to write it out while making sure to not have any small bugs which can break the whole program. It was also hard to visualize a lot of the coding in my head which means I should maybe do some of it on paper or something like that.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

I could use the match function to search for certain movies by seeing if the pattern I enter matches anything in the df. For example if the df has the director I could search for all of the movies by the same director as well.
